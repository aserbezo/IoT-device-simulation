The Azure IoT Device SDK for Python enables  easily create IoT device  that can connect to the Azure IoT Hub ecosystem.

## Installing the library

The Azure IoT Device library is available on PyPI:

```Shell
pip install azure-iot-device
```

Python 3.7 or higher is required in order to use the library


When you send a message from a device to Azure IoT Hub, the message body is typically encoded because IoT Hub accepts messages in a binary format. This encoding ensures that the message content can be transmitted efficiently over the network and processed correctly by Azure services.

Here's what typically happens when you send a message from a device to Azure IoT Hub:

- Message Encoding: The message content (such as telemetry data or commands) is encoded into a binary format. This encoding may involve serialization of the message content into a byte array or another binary representation.
  
- Transmission to IoT Hub: The encoded message is then transmitted from the device to Azure IoT Hub over a network connection. IoT Hub supports various communication protocols, such as MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP, which are used to send messages to the hub.
  
- Processing by IoT Hub: Upon receiving the message, Azure IoT Hub processes the message and forwards it to the appropriate endpoint or destination. This could involve routing the message to other Azure services, storing it in a database, or triggering actions based on the message content.
  
- Decoding by Azure Services: Azure services that receive the message from IoT Hub may decode the message content to interpret its meaning and perform further processing. For example, Azure Stream Analytics or Azure Functions may decode the message to extract telemetry data or execute commands.
  
- Application Processing: Finally, the decoded message content is processed by the application or service running in the Azure environment. This could involve analyzing telemetry data, triggering alerts or notifications, or taking other actions based on the message content.ded
